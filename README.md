ConnectTel is a global leader in telecommunications, offering advanced voice, data, and internet services. 
This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning  propose effective retention initiativesto enhance retention strategies and maintain competitive advantage. 
Univariate and bivariate analysis was done to understand data distribution and variable relationships.
Multivariate analysis was used to examine correlations and interactions among different variables.
For data preprocessing, Categorical variables were encoded numerically, resampling techniques were applied to address class imbalance and MinMaxScaler was used for data scaling
Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier were used.
The model was evaluated using accuracy metrics and a confusion matrix.
